# mysql_multi

==================================================================================================
Installation
==================================================================================================
<p>=> Just download the "mysql_multi" file in RHEL/CentOS based server.</p>
<p>=> Give executable permission to the downloaded file.</p>
<p>=> Run the file according path</p>
<p>=> By default the location is set to as "/usr/local/" for additional MySQL instance</p>
<p>=> After running the file need to provide the expected folder name (i.e: MySQL_new)</p>
<p>=> By default the MySQL gets installed with 3306 port. But with this installer it will ask for a free port in server.</p>

==================================================================================================
Prerequisite
==================================================================================================

<p>=> MariaDB has not been tested with the script. Up to MySQL 5.6 has been tested with the script working fine. So to install additional MySQL instance a MySQL must be there in the server.</p>
